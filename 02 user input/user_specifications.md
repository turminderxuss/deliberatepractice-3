Please help me create a very simple web app that just shows the moon, as it will be at 10 pm tonight, no matter where I would see it.

It should be a simple flask server (or something, I work in python) that serves a simple, but well built website that displays an image of the moon as it will be based on date alone.
Give me a full overview first of the project architecture and flow (as plantuml files), and the source of information on the moon and imagery.
