# Moon Phase Visualization Web Application

## Project Overview

This project is a simple web application that displays an image of the moon as it appears at 10 PM on the current date. The application is built as a Python Flask web server that serves a clean, well-designed website. The application does not store any data and generates the moon phase visualization on-demand when requested.

## Stakeholders

- End Users: People interested in viewing the current moon phase
- Developers: Team responsible for building and maintaining the application
- AI Assistant (Claude): Handles code generation, architecture design, and documentation

## User Stories

### Core User Stories

1. As a user, I want to see the current moon phase at 10 PM tonight so that I know how the moon will appear in the sky.
2. As a user, I want the application to work on mobile and desktop devices so that I can check the moon phase from any device.
3. As a user, I want a clean, simple interface so that I can easily view the moon without distractions.

### Extended User Stories

1. As a user, I want to know the percentage of moon illumination so that I have precise data about the moon phase.
2. As a user, I want the page to automatically refresh daily so that I always see the current moon phase.
3. As a user, I want basic information about the current moon phase (name and description) so that I can learn more about it.

## Acceptance Criteria

### User Story 1: View Current Moon Phase

```gherkin
Feature: Moon Phase Visualization

  Scenario: Viewing the moon phase for tonight
    Given I am on the application homepage
    When the page loads
    Then I should see an image of the moon as it will appear at 10 PM tonight
    And the image should accurately reflect the current moon phase
    
  Scenario: Automatic date detection
    Given I am on the application homepage
    When the page loads
    Then the application should automatically use today's date
    And display the correct moon phase for 10 PM tonight
```

### User Story 2: Cross-device Compatibility

```gherkin
Feature: Cross-device Compatibility

  Scenario: Viewing on desktop
    Given I am on a desktop device
    When I access the application
    Then the interface should be properly formatted for desktop viewing
    
  Scenario: Viewing on mobile
    Given I am on a mobile device
    When I access the application
    Then the interface should be responsive
    And properly formatted for mobile viewing
```

## Functional Requirements

### Web Server Component

1. Implement a Python Flask server to handle HTTP requests and serve the web application.
2. Create a single endpoint (`/`) that displays the moon phase visualization.
3. Set appropriate HTTP headers for caching and performance.
4. Handle potential errors gracefully with appropriate error pages.

### Moon Phase Calculation Component

1. Use a reputable astronomical library (e.g., `ephem`, `skyfield`, or `astropy`) to calculate accurate moon phase data.
2. Calculate the moon phase for the current date at 10 PM.
3. Determine the percentage of illumination and the current phase name (e.g., New Moon, First Quarter, Full Moon, Last Quarter).
4. Provide functions to convert astronomical data into a format usable by the visualization component.

### Visualization Component

1. Generate or retrieve an accurate visual representation of the current moon phase.
2. Display the moon phase image prominently on the page.
3. Show the current phase name and percentage of illumination.
4. Ensure the visualization is accurate and visually appealing.

### UI Component

1. Implement a clean, minimalist UI that focuses on the moon visualization.
2. Ensure the UI is responsive and works well on both mobile and desktop devices.
3. Use appropriate typography and spacing for readability.
4. Include minimal branding and attribution information.

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance

1. The application should load within 2 seconds on a standard broadband connection.
2. The moon phase calculation should complete in under 500 milliseconds.
3. The application should be optimized for minimal resource usage.

### Security

1. Implement appropriate HTTP security headers.
2. Sanitize all user inputs (if any in future extensions).
3. Keep dependencies updated to avoid security vulnerabilities.

### Usability

1. The interface should be intuitive with no instructions needed.
2. The visualization should be clearly visible on screens of all sizes.
3. Text should have sufficient contrast for readability.
4. The application should be accessible according to WCAG 2.1 AA standards.

## Data Models

### MoonPhaseData

- Attributes:
  - date: Date - The date for which the moon phase is calculated
  - illumination_percent: Float - Percentage of the moon that is illuminated (0.0 to 100.0)
  - phase_name: String - The name of the current moon phase
  - phase_angle: Float - The phase angle in degrees (0-360)
  - next_phase_date: Date - The date of the next major phase change
  - next_phase_name: String - The name of the next major phase

## API Specifications

### Endpoint: /

- Method: GET
- Description: Main endpoint that serves the moon phase visualization
- Request: No parameters required
- Response: HTML page with the moon phase visualization
- Error Responses:
  - 500: Server error during moon phase calculation or visualization generation

## System Architecture

The system follows a hexagonal (ports and adapters) architecture to ensure clean separation of concerns:

1. Core Domain:
   - Moon phase calculation logic
   - Data transformation utilities

2. Primary Adapters (Driving Side):
   - Web interface (Flask routes and controllers)
   - API controllers (for potential future extensions)

3. Secondary Adapters (Driven Side):
   - Astronomical data source adapter (interacts with the chosen astronomy library)
   - Visualization generator adapter (creates or retrieves moon images)

4. Application Services:
   - Orchestrates the flow between adapters and core domain
   - Handles business logic and use cases

The detailed architecture is illustrated in the accompanying PlantUML diagrams.

## Design Constraints

1. The application must be built using Python and Flask.
2. The application should not require a database or persistent storage.
3. The moon phase calculation must be accurate using established astronomical calculations.
4. The application must be deployable as a simple web service without complex infrastructure.

## Assumptions and Dependencies

### Assumptions

1. Users have access to a modern web browser.
2. The server has internet access to fetch required astronomical data if needed.
3. The application is intended for informational purposes and not for critical astronomical observations.

### Dependencies

1. Python 3.8 or higher
2. Flask web framework
3. An astronomical library (either `ephem`, `skyfield`, or `astropy`)
4. Optional: A source of moon phase images if not generated programmatically

## Glossary

- Moon Phase: The apparent shape of the illuminated portion of the Moon as seen from Earth
- New Moon: The phase when the Moon is not visible from Earth as its unilluminated side faces Earth
- Full Moon: The phase when the Moon appears fully illuminated from Earth's perspective
- First Quarter: The phase when half of the Moon appears illuminated (on the right side for Northern Hemisphere)
- Last Quarter: The phase when half of the Moon appears illuminated (on the left side for Northern Hemisphere)
- Waxing: The period when the visible illuminated portion of the Moon is increasing
- Waning: The period when the visible illuminated portion of the Moon is decreasing

## References

1. Astronomical calculations will be based on standard ephemeris data and algorithms
2. Moon imagery may be sourced from NASA's public domain images or generated programmatically
