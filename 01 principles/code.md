# Code Principles

## Overview

This document outlines the coding principles and practices to be followed in the Vibe Coding process. These principles guide how code is written, tested, and maintained throughout the development lifecycle.

## Core Code Principles

### 1. Test-Driven Development (TDD)

All code is developed following TDD principles:

- **Tests First**: Write tests before implementation code
- **Minimal Implementation**: Write the simplest code that passes the tests
- **Refactoring**: Refactor code to improve design without changing behavior
- **Test Coverage**: Aim for comprehensive test coverage
- **Executable Specifications**: Tests serve as executable specifications

### 2. Property-Based Testing

In addition to traditional unit tests, property-based testing ensures robust behavior:

- **Property Identification**: Identify invariant properties the code must maintain
- **Test Generation**: Generate thousands of test cases automatically
- **Edge Case Discovery**: Automatically discover edge cases
- **Shrinking**: When a failure is found, shrink to the simplest failing case
- **Statistical Verification**: Run tests multiple times to detect non-deterministic behavior

### 3. Design by Contract

Code follows design by contract principles:

- **Preconditions**: Define what must be true before a function executes
- **Postconditions**: Define what must be true after a function executes
- **Invariants**: Define what must always be true
- **Explicit Contracts**: Contracts are explicitly documented and tested
- **Contract Enforcement**: Contracts are enforced at runtime

### 4. Clean Code

Code adheres to clean code principles:

- **Readability**: Code is written to be read by humans
- **Meaningful Names**: Variables, functions, and classes have meaningful names
- **Single Responsibility**: Functions and classes have a single responsibility
- **Small Functions**: Functions are small and focused
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Avoid code duplication
- **Comments**: Comments explain why, not what
- **Formatting**: Consistent formatting (PEP 8 for Python)

### 5. Error Handling

Robust error handling is essential:

- **Explicit Error Handling**: Errors are explicitly handled, not ignored
- **Appropriate Mechanisms**: Use appropriate error handling mechanisms (exceptions, return codes, etc.)
- **Meaningful Messages**: Error messages are clear and informative
- **Fail Fast**: Detect and report errors as early as possible
- **Graceful Degradation**: Systems degrade gracefully when possible

### 6. Security Best Practices

Code follows security best practices:

- **Input Validation**: All inputs are validated
- **Output Encoding**: All outputs are properly encoded
- **Secure Defaults**: Security-conscious default configurations
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Code operates with minimal necessary permissions
- **Security Testing**: Security is tested alongside functionality

## Coding Standards

### Python Standards

- **PEP 8**: Follow PEP 8 style guide
- **Type Hints**: Use type hints for better code clarity and tool support
- **Docstrings**: Document all modules, classes, and functions with docstrings
- **Google Style**: Follow Google Python Style Guide for docstrings
- **Linting**: Use tools like flake8, pylint, or black for code quality

### Documentation Standards

- **Comprehensive Comments**: Code includes comprehensive comments
- **API Documentation**: All APIs are fully documented
- **Usage Examples**: Include usage examples for complex functionality
- **Architecture Documentation**: Document architectural decisions
- **Changelog**: Maintain a changelog for version history

### Version Control Standards

- **Atomic Commits**: Make small, focused commits
- **Meaningful Messages**: Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- **Feature Branches**: Develop features in dedicated branches
- **Pull Requests**: Use pull requests for code review
- **Version Tagging**: Tag releases with version numbers

## Code Generation Principles

When generating code with Claude:

- **Specification First**: Start with clear specifications
- **Test-Driven Generation**: Generate tests before implementation
- **Iterative Refinement**: Refine code through iterative feedback
- **Review and Validate**: Review generated code carefully
- **Documentation Generation**: Generate documentation alongside code

## Code Patterns and Best Practices

### Python-Specific Patterns

- **Context Managers**: Use context managers for resource management
- **Generators**: Use generators for efficient iteration
- **Decorators**: Use decorators to separate cross-cutting concerns
- **Dataclasses**: Use dataclasses for data containers
- **Dependency Injection**: Use dependency injection for testability

### General Patterns

- **Factory Pattern**: Create objects without specifying the exact class
- **Strategy Pattern**: Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable
- **Observer Pattern**: Define a one-to-many dependency between objects
- **Decorator Pattern**: Add responsibilities to objects dynamically
- **Command Pattern**: Encapsulate a request as an object

## Continuous Improvement

Code is continuously improved:

- **Regular Refactoring**: Regularly refactor code to improve design
- **Technical Debt Management**: Identify and address technical debt
- **Performance Optimization**: Optimize code for performance where necessary
- **Feedback Integration**: Integrate feedback from reviews and testing
- **Learning and Adaptation**: Learn from experience and adapt practices

By following these code principles, we ensure high-quality, maintainable code that meets business needs while being robust and secure.
