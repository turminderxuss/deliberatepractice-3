# Architecture Principles

## Overview

This document outlines the architectural principles to be followed in the Vibe Coding process. These principles guide the design and implementation of systems developed using this methodology, ensuring quality, maintainability, and scalability.

## Core Architectural Principles

### 1. Specification-Driven Architecture with Formal Contracts

The foundation of our architecture is a formal specification system that enforces architectural boundaries:

- **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)**: Use Gherkin syntax (Given/When/Then) to create machine-readable specifications
- **Design by Contract**: Each component must define precise preconditions, postconditions, and invariants
- **Formal Interfaces**: All component interactions must occur through well-defined interfaces
- **Component Isolation**: Components should be isolated with minimal dependencies

This approach creates a structural backbone that prevents code from becoming unwieldy while maintaining human-readable artifacts that aren't code.

### 2. Modular Design

The system is built from modular, loosely-coupled components:

- **Single Responsibility**: Each component should have a single, well-defined responsibility
- **Encapsulation**: Components should encapsulate their internal implementation details
- **Interface Segregation**: Interfaces should be specific to client needs
- **Dependency Inversion**: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules
- **Configuration Over Modification**: Behavior should be configurable without modifying code

### 3. Hexagonal/Ports and Adapters Architecture

The system follows a hexagonal (ports and adapters) architecture:

- **Core Domain Logic**: The center contains pure business logic with no external dependencies
- **Ports**: Interfaces that define how the core interacts with the outside world
- **Adapters**: Implementations of ports that connect to specific technologies
- **Dependency Direction**: Dependencies point inward, toward the core
- **Technology Independence**: The core is independent of specific technologies

### 4. Pipeline-Based Processing

Data processing follows a pipeline-based approach:

- **Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) Pattern**: Clear separation of extraction, transformation, and loading
- **Composable Transformations**: Transformations can be composed and reused
- **Data Immutability**: Transformations create new data rather than modifying existing data
- **Explicit Data Flow**: Data flow is explicit and traceable
- **Idempotent Operations**: Operations should be idempotent where possible

### 5. Observability by Design

Systems are designed with observability as a core concern:

- **Comprehensive Logging**: Every significant action is logged
- **Metrics Collection**: Key performance indicators are collected
- **Distributed Tracing**: Request flows can be traced across components
- **Health Checks**: Components expose health check endpoints
- **Telemetry Aggregation**: Telemetry is aggregated for analysis

### 6. Security by Design

Security is integrated into the architecture from the beginning:

- **Least Privilege**: Components operate with minimal necessary permissions
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
- **Input Validation**: All inputs are validated at the boundaries
- **Secure Defaults**: Security-conscious default configurations
- **Auditability**: Actions are auditable and traceable

## Component Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Connectors (Input Adapters)**
   - Purpose: Extract data from external sources
   - Responsibilities:
     - Connect to data sources (CSV, databases, APIs, etc.)
     - Extract data in a standardized format
     - Handle source-specific error conditions
   - Interface: Standard Reader interface with read method

2. **Actions (Transformations)**
   - Purpose: Transform data
   - Responsibilities:
     - Apply transformations to data
     - Validate data against expectations
     - Maintain data integrity
   - Interface: Standard Action interface with apply method

3. **Writers (Output Adapters)**
   - Purpose: Load data to destinations
   - Responsibilities:
     - Format data for destination
     - Write data to destination
     - Handle destination-specific error conditions
   - Interface: Standard Writer interface with write method

4. **Pipeline Orchestrator**
   - Purpose: Coordinate data flow
   - Responsibilities:
     - Manage pipeline execution
     - Handle errors and retries
     - Track execution status
   - Interface: Pipeline management interface

5. **Configuration Manager**
   - Purpose: Manage system configuration
   - Responsibilities:
     - Load and validate configurations
     - Provide configuration to components
     - Support environment-specific configurations
   - Interface: Configuration access interface

### Common Patterns

1. **Factory Pattern**
   - Use factories to create component instances based on configuration
   - Support dependency injection for testing

2. **Strategy Pattern**
   - Encapsulate algorithms in strategy classes
   - Allow algorithms to be selected at runtime

3. **Observer Pattern**
   - Use for event-driven communication between components
   - Support decoupling of components

4. **Decorator Pattern**
   - Extend component behavior without modifying core logic
   - Add cross-cutting concerns like logging, metrics, and validation

5. **Command Pattern**
   - Encapsulate operations as objects
   - Support operations history, undo/redo, and queuing

## Data Flow

1. **Source → Connector**: External source data is extracted by a connector
2. **Connector → Action**: Connector provides standardized data to actions
3. **Action → Action**: Actions can be chained for complex transformations
4. **Action → Writer**: Transformed data is passed to writers
5. **Writer → Destination**: Writers load data to external destinations

## Error Handling

1. **Hierarchical Error Management**
   - Low-level errors are captured and propagated
   - Errors include context for diagnosis
   - Errors are categorized by type and severity

2. **Retry Strategies**
   - Transient errors are retried with appropriate backoff
   - Retry policies are configurable
   - Retry limits prevent infinite loops

3. **Failure Recovery**
   - System can recover from failures where possible
   - Failures are logged for analysis
   - Cleanup actions are performed after failures

## Extension Points

The architecture provides clear extension points for future enhancements:

1. **New Connectors**: Add new connector implementations for different data sources
2. **Custom Actions**: Implement custom transformations for specific needs
3. **Additional Writers**: Create writers for new destination types
4. **Enhanced Pipelines**: Extend pipeline capabilities with new features
5. **Advanced Monitoring**: Integrate with additional monitoring tools

By following these architectural principles, we can create maintainable, extensible systems that meet business needs while ensuring quality and performance.
