# Roles in the Vibe Coding Process

## Overview

The Vibe Coding methodology defines clear roles and responsibilities for both human participants and AI assistants (particularly Claude). This document outlines these roles and how they collaborate to create high-quality software with minimal manual coding.

## Role Division Philosophy

The development process is based on a clear division of responsibilities between the LLM (artificial programmer) and the human collaborator:

### LLM Role (Claude as "The Mind")

Claude serves as an intelligent exocortex and takes responsibility for:

- **Architectural design and planning**
  - Generating system architecture diagrams
  - Designing component interactions
  - Creating data flow documentation

- **Code generation and modification**
  - Writing test code first (TDD approach)
  - Implementing code to pass tests
  - Refactoring and optimizing code

- **Test case design**
  - Creating comprehensive unit tests
  - Designing integration tests
  - Implementing property-based tests and fuzzing

- **Technical documentation**
  - Writing docstrings and comments
  - Generating README files and API docs
  - Documenting architectural decisions

- **Problem-solving and debugging strategies**
  - Analyzing test failures
  - Proposing fixes for bugs
  - Suggesting performance improvements

- **Code update script generation**
  - Creating scripts for code modifications
  - Generating migration scripts
  - Building deployment configurations

### Human Role (The Product Owner)

The human partner focuses on high-level direction and decision-making:

- **Vision and requirements definition**
  - Defining the overall purpose and goals
  - Setting priorities and constraints
  - Making high-level architectural decisions

- **Use case and user story provision**
  - Describing user needs and experiences
  - Defining acceptance criteria
  - Validating specifications

- **Design feedback and direction**
  - Reviewing and refining specifications
  - Providing feedback on architectural designs
  - Making key design decisions

- **Physical interaction with development environment**
  - Running tests and builds
  - Executing deployment scripts
  - Interacting with source control

- **Test execution and result reporting**
  - Running test suites
  - Reporting test failures to Claude
  - Validating fixes

- **Manual testing and user experience validation**
  - Testing the application from a user perspective
  - Providing feedback on usability
  - Identifying edge cases and issues

- **Bridging between LLM capabilities and system requirements**
  - Translating business needs into tasks for Claude
  - Interpreting Claude's output
  - Guiding Claude's focus and priorities

## Collaboration Model

The human and Claude work as partners in a collaborative development process:

1. **Human provides high-level direction**
   - Describes the desired outcome
   - Sets constraints and requirements
   - Defines key user stories

2. **Claude transforms direction into specifications**
   - Creates detailed specifications
   - Designs architecture and components
   - Proposes implementation approach

3. **Human reviews and refines specifications**
   - Provides feedback on specifications
   - Clarifies requirements
   - Approves specifications for implementation

4. **Claude implements specifications**
   - Writes tests and code
   - Documents implementation
   - Creates deployment configurations

5. **Human verifies implementation**
   - Runs tests and reviews results
   - Provides feedback on implementation
   - Approves implementation or requests changes

6. **Claude refines implementation**
   - Addresses feedback
   - Improves code quality
   - Expands test coverage

This iterative cycle continues throughout the development process, with the human guiding the high-level direction while Claude handles the implementation details.

## Communication Patterns

Effective communication between the human and Claude is essential:

- **Clear, specific requests**: Humans should provide clear, specific requests to Claude
- **Iterative refinement**: Both parties should engage in iterative refinement of specifications and implementations
- **Feedback loops**: Regular feedback cycles ensure alignment and quality
- **Decision documentation**: Important decisions should be documented for future reference

## Best Practices for Humans

- **Focus on intent, not implementation**: Communicate what you want to achieve, not how to achieve it
- **Provide context**: Share relevant context to help Claude understand requirements
- **Ask questions**: If Claude's output is unclear, ask clarifying questions
- **Verify key points**: Ensure Claude understands critical requirements
- **Review output**: Carefully review Claude's output, especially for critical components

## Best Practices for Claude

- **Seek clarification**: Ask questions when requirements are unclear
- **Explain reasoning**: Provide rationale for important decisions
- **Highlight trade-offs**: Identify trade-offs in design and implementation
- **Suggest alternatives**: Offer alternative approaches when appropriate
- **Be thorough**: Ensure comprehensive coverage of requirements

By following these role guidelines, humans and Claude can effectively collaborate to develop high-quality software with minimal manual coding.
